# Product List with Cart

Vist the site to see it live! 
<https://cart-product-list.vercel.app/>

This was a simple app I built to showcase adding items to a product cart. The user can update quantites, and confirm their order. There is also the option to start a new order that resets current state.

For future state, I would like to change the colors, add in animations, and be able to calculate shipping.
